AngularPlayground
=================

Learning Angular is hard. Not because of the lack of documentation. There're tons of examples.

The real issue is that its practitioners adhere to some highly opinionated guidelines.

And I'm still in the quest for those guidelines.

This sample was originally a test I made for a job interview. I flunked it. It seems that I've should moved the server queries to a service.

Now I'm using this small widget to experiment. Putting it in github is makind myself a public warning: follow the guidelines or else! And when you find those guidelines, drop me a note.
